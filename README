Notes:

To build the programs, run make all in the same directory.

* You may run the consumer with only one argument, number of buffers, in which case it will match all the text in the file. (Don't pass it a search string.)

* Built, run, (not really) tested on fc21.x86_64, and gcc version 4.9.2 20150212 (Red Hat 4.9.2-6) (GCC)

Run the producer first in one shell:

./producer 16 ~/.emacs

and the consumer in another shell:

./consumer 16 "(defun ew()  "

and, you may run consumer with only the first argument, in which case it will print all the text in the buffer.
